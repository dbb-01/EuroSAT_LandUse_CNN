<b>Abstract</b> <br>
Land use and land cover change (LULCC) are important in natural resource management, environmental modelling and assessment, and ecological connectivity management. However, LULCC detection and modelling is a complex data-driven process. In the present work, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed due to its great potential in image classification. The development of these tools applies the deep learning method. A methodology has been developed that classifies the set of land uses in a natural area of special protection. This study area covers the Sierra del Cando (Galicia, northwest Spain), considered by the European Union as a Site of Community Interest and integrated in the Natura 2000 Network. The results of the CNN model developed show an accuracy of 91% on training dataset and 88% on test dataset. In addition, the model was tested on images of the study area, both from Sentinel-2 and PNOA. Despite some confusion especially in the residential class due to the characteristics in this area, CNNs prove to be a powerful classification tool.
